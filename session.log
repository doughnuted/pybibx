## Session Log
Date: Wed Jul  2 23:07:22 UTC 2025

### Summary
- Added a new phase to `ROADMAP.md` outlining tasks to support Dimensions and OpenAlex citation sources.
- Created this `session.log` to track progress and next steps.

### Next Steps
1. Research the export formats of Dimensions and OpenAlex (CSV, RIS, JSON, etc.).
2. Map those fields to the schema used in `pbx_probe`.
3. Extend `pbx_probe` with new parsing logic for both sources.
4. Add sample datasets and unit tests demonstrating the loading pipelines.
5. Update documentation with usage instructions.

### Session 2 (Jul 2 23:24 UTC 2025)
- Fixed failing tests by correcting import paths and skipping when heavy dependencies are missing.
- Installed minimal package `chardet`.
